# Jimbot
**A Facebook messenger utility bot.**

Jimbot runs on node.js platform. It uses [facebook-chat-api](https://github.com/Schmavery/facebook-chat-api) as the main component. The bot latches onto a Facebook account, and listens to all incoming messages for triggers. User can add the bot  to any group chat, or simply message the bot to see its response.

## Install and run
```bash
npm start
```

If you want to login through saved environmental variables:
```bash
export LOGIN_METHOD="ENV_VAR"
export BOT_EMAIL="email@foobar.com"
export BOT_PASSWORD="facebook-password"
npm start
```

If you want to store your login session a file for up to three months:
```bash
npm install
node saveAppState.js
export LOGIN_METHOD="APP_STATE"
export APP_STATE=$(cat appstate.json)
npm start
```
WARNING: The generated file `appstate.json` contains your login session cookie. Do NOT share it with anyone.
This login method stores this session cookie in the environment variable APP_STATE, which is only visible to you.

[node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a required dependency.
